📸 Instagram Clone – SQL-Based Backend Simulation
This project is a SQL-based Instagram Clone that replicates the core backend functionality of a social media platform using MySQL. The primary focus is on designing a robust and normalized relational database system to support user interactions, photo sharing, and engagement analytics. It also includes advanced SQL queries to extract valuable insights and detect suspicious or bot-like behavior.

🛠 Tech Stack
Database Engine: MySQL
Language: SQL

Concepts Used: Relational Database Design, Normalization, Indexing, Joins, Aggregations, Subqueries

🧠 Skills Demonstrated
✔ Entity-Relationship (ER) modeling and database schema design
✔ Implementation of normalized tables and many-to-many relationships using join tables
✔ Writing efficient and optimized SQL queries for CRUD operations and analytics
✔ Real-world business intelligence through custom SQL reporting
✔ Detection logic for abnormal user behavior (e.g., bot activity)

🗃 Features Implemented
🔐 User Registration & Login: Securely stores user credentials and manages unique user sessions
🖼 Photo Uploading: Allows users to post photos along with captions
❤ Likes & Comments: Enables user interactions through liking and commenting on posts
🔁 Follow/Unfollow Mechanism: Establishes user relationships to build a dynamic feed
🏷 Hashtag Tagging: Tags can be associated with photos to enable search and categorization
🤖 Bot Detection System: Detects suspicious users who interact excessively or unnaturally
📈 Engagement Analytics: Tracks user activity, trends, and content performance

📊 Key SQL Queries & Business Insights
📌 Average Posts per User
Understand overall user engagement by measuring average activity levels.
👥 Oldest Users
Identify early adopters of the platform — useful for loyalty rewards or legacy features.
📆 Signup Trends by Weekday
Analyze user signups based on weekdays to plan targeted ad campaigns or promotions.
😴 Inactive Users
Detect users who haven’t posted or interacted recently — helpful for re-engagement efforts.
🏆 Most Liked Photo
Useful for identifying high-performing content or winners of user-generated contests.
🔥 Top 5Hashtags
Pinpoint trending topics and optimize content strategies for brand engagement.
⚠ Bot Detection Logic
Identify accounts that like every photo, a behavior commonly associated with bots or fake engagement.

💡 Future Improvements
Add stored procedures or triggers for automatic notifications
Introduce indexing for performance optimization on large datasets
Extend to include private/public post privacy settings
Create a frontend or REST API to interact with the database

📌 Use Cases
Academic projects to demonstrate database design skills
Portfolio project for backend/database engineer roles
Reference for building scalable social media data models
Practice tool for writing and optimizing SQL queries
